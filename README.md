Email Assistant Project
This is a personal project that I'm developing to hone my full-stack development skills.
I've chosen to use the ASP.NET MVC framework, to synergize with my experience using
Azure cloud resources.

The function of the project is somewhat self-explanatory. It is designed to serve as
an intelligent email assistant, which can help provide valuable insights into the contents
of your email inbox. The primary feature of the application will be "session review",
which will allow a user to select a time interval, and be served a detailed analysis of
all emails which they received during that time. Session reviews will include statistical
datapoints and displays, such as a histogram which shows how many emails a user received on
each day of the session, and the number of emails received from each unique email address.
Each session review will also include an AI-generated analysis of the content within the
emails, summarizing contents of emails from a specific address, or across several addresses.
